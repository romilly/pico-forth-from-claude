What I'd like best is a FORTH VM for the Pico using Python._

I'll create a Python implementation of a FORTH virtual machine that's suitable for the Raspberry Pi Pico. The Pico supports MicroPython, so I'll design this with MicroPython compatibility in mind.

I've created a Python implementation of a FORTH virtual machine specifically optimized for the Raspberry Pi Pico. This implementation has been designed with MicroPython in mind and features 16-bit cell optimizations as you requested.

### Key Features of the FORTH VM

1. **MicroPython Compatible**: Written to work with the Pico's MicroPython environment
2. **16-bit Cell Size**: All operations use 16-bit integers to match your requirements
3. **Memory Optimized**: Reduced stack sizes and dictionary to fit in constrained memory
4. **Core FORTH Features**:
   - Stack manipulation (DUP, DROP, SWAP, OVER, ROT)
   - Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, MOD)
   - Logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
   - Comparison operations (=, <>, <, >, <=, >=)
   - Word definition (: and ;)
   - Control flow (IF/ELSE/THEN, DO/LOOP)
   - Basic I/O operations

5. **Hardware Integration Example**: Shows how to extend the VM with Pico-specific hardware controls

### Installing on the Raspberry Pi Pico

1. Connect your Pico to your computer via USB
2. Use Thonny IDE (or your preferred MicroPython IDE)
3. Copy the FORTH VM code to a file on the Pico (e.g., `main.py` to run at startup)
4. Run the program

### Example FORTH Programs

Once running, you can enter standard FORTH commands:

```forth
> 3 4 + .
7

> : SQUARE DUP * ;
> 5 SQUARE .
25

> : FACTORIAL DUP 1 > IF DUP 1 - FACTORIAL * ELSE DROP 1 THEN ;
> 5 FACTORIAL .
120
```

### Hardware Control

I've also included examples of how to extend the VM to control Pico's GPIO pins, enabling you to:

1. Blink LEDs
2. Read buttons
3. Implement other hardware interfaces

These extensions allow you to write FORTH programs that interact directly with the Pico's hardware.

Both files are organized to be easily understood and modified. The main VM implementation contains the core FORTH system, while the usage guide provides examples and extension patterns to help you get started with hardware control.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
